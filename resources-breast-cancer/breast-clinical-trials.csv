Study of the original cohort will be focused on localized breast cancer patients, other localisation in non-metastatic setting will be explored furtherwise, fist of all in lung cancer.

The project will include four specific aims :

1. To develop a database of chronic treatment related toxicity in a cohort of 14750 women with stage I-III breast cancer (= non metastatic), whatever these treatments are (surgery; radiation therapy; chemotherapy ...)
2. To describe incidence, clinical presentation, and outcome of chronic toxicities.
3. To describe the psychological, the social and the economic impacts of chronic toxicities.
4. To generate predictors for chronic toxicities in order to prevent them, based upon biological criteria.

The expected impact of these toxicities, when identified, will be to improve quality of life and to decrease health cost, by the early identification of patients at high risk of toxicity. Such early identification could lead to prevent toxic effect by: a. developing prevention strategies, b. substituting toxic treatment by a non (less) toxic one.

NCT05512260,"Development, Implementation and Evaluation of an Individual Decision Aid in Swedish Cancer Screening Programs",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05512260,BESTa,RECRUITING,"Background: Sweden has a long tradition of organized national population-based screening programs. Participation rates differ between programs and regions, are relatively high in some groups, but lower in other. To apply an equity perspective on screening, it is desired that individuals make an informed decision on knowledge rather than ignorance, misconceptions, or fear. Decision Aids (DAs) are set to deliver information about different health care options and to help individuals make visible values connected to the options available. DAs are not meant to guide individuals to choose one option over the another. The advantage of an individual Decision Aid (iDA) is that individuals gain knowledge on cancer and screening entering one webpage with possibility to communicate with health professionals and thereafter make their decision regarding participate. The primary objective is therefore to develop and implement a web-based iDA for individuals invited to cancer screening in Sweden. The secondary objective is to evaluate the implemented web-based iDA.

Methods: This study has an evaluative approach with both a process-, an implementation and an outcome evaluation. Multiple methods will be used including patient reported data, focus group discussions and individual interviews using the think aloud technique. The project is based on the framework from The International Patient Decision Aid Standards (IPDAS) and the proposed model development process for DAs as presented by Coulter et al. Individuals aged 23-74, including women aged (the cervical- and breast- and bowel cancer screening module) and men aged (the bowel cancer screening module), will be included in the developmental process. Efforts will be made to recruit participants with disabilities, who live outside society and who are foreign born.

Discussion: To the best of our knowledge the present study is the first aiming at developing an iDA for usage in Swedish context, The iDA is intended to contribute so that individuals invited to screening base their decision on knowledge and with a clear picture of their values and preferences, rather than ignorance, misconceptions, or fear.

However, chronic pain after breast cancer remains under-recognised and undertreated. An effective and patient-tailored approach of (chronic) pain after breast cancer indeed requires a thorough knowledge and

evaluation of the pain. In daily clinical practice, however, guidelines for a comprehensive diagnosis of pain in cancer patients and survivors are lacking. Further research in this topic is crucial for an efficient, preventive as well as curative, approach of pain after breast cancer. Besides the high prevalence and the important impact of pain in this population, the breast cancer population is also an ideal population to study chronic pain and its natural time course in different stages, since most patients start pain-free, but almost half of them end up

with chronic pain. Therefore, this study aims to map biomarkers (both predictive, prognostic and diagnostic) for chronic pain after breast cancer treatment. We will study possible biopsychosocial biomarkers in

relation to (chronic) pain and monitor their temporal changes from the moment of diagnosis until 1 year after surgery.

NCT05851053,Breast Cancer Long-term Outcomes on Cardiac Functioning: a Longitudinal Study,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05851053,BLOC-II,RECRUITING,"Rationale: In addition to surgery, effective breast cancer (BC) treatment typically requires chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or both. However, it is still unclear whether patients with BC are at increased risk of long-term cardiac dysfunction due to the adverse effects of these therapies. In a cross-sectional study in primary care, a comparison on cardiac dysfunction between 350 BC survivors and 350 age- and general practitioner (GP)- matched controls without cancer was made. In that study, BC survivors were at increased risk of mild systolic cardiac dysfunction (left ventricle ejection fraction (LVEF)\< 54%). By contrast, there was no significant difference in an LVEF \< 50% or in diastolic dysfunction. To date it remains uncertain whether the mild or subclinical dysfunction we observed predicts further cardiac deterioration. Consequently, the translation of these results into guidelines for the daily practice of the GP is unclear.

Objective: The aim of the here proposed study is to clarify whether cardiac function in survivors of BC should be monitored by GPs, by assessing whether an unselected population of long-term BC survivors is at increased risk of developing cardiac dysfunction, whether in this group at-risk subgroups exists, and what factors are associated with the highest risk.

Study design: A new assessment of cardiac function among women included in the BLOC-I study. This produces a longitudinal matched cohort design consisting of two cohorts in primary care.

Study population: Survivors of BC, diagnosed ≥11 years ago who received chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy, and a matched reference population with no history of cancer. All participants participated in the Breast cancer Long-term Outcome of Cardiac function (BLOC-I) study.

In the United Kingdom it is estimated that over 40% of elderly women do not receive surgery for their breast cancer, and that their primary treatment is hormonal only, the so-called primary endocrinotherapy.

In Italy the recent AIOM guidelines of 2019 exclude, in patients with hormone-sensitive disease and age older than 70, the omission of surgery in favor of hormone therapy alone, thus underlining the importance of a treatment local. However, there are currently no local treatments that could in any way effectively control the primary tumor.

In recent years, SRT has widely found space as a therapeutic alternative in patients not fit for surgery.

Stereotactic Radiotherapy is a non-invasive treatment with ablative intent obtained with highly focused high intensity fields for a few fractions (generally 1-5). It is the standard treatment for surgically inoperable lung cancers, and is also used in the treatment of liver metastases, intermediate-risk prostate cancer and locally advanced pancreatic cancers. The applications of stereotactic treatment in breast cancer are limited to the neoadjuvant and adjuvant setting.

Nowadays, various studies have demonstrated that estrogen interacts with many angiogenic pathways and is an important mechanism for resistance leading to the question of whether combination with antiangiogenesis and antiestrogen therapies could be an appropriate therapeutic modality. Anlotinib is a novel multi-target tyrosine kinase inhibitor that effectively inhibit VEGFR, FGFR, PDGFR, c-KIT, c-MET and RET.

Often performed after a screening test, stereotactic macrobiopsies are used to characterize abnormalities detected on mammography.

Faced with this observation, investigators wondered what could be done to improve the experience of the patients during this examination.

This type of breast cancer is not sensitive to chemotherapy, although it has a low mortality rate and distant metastasis rate. Studies have shown that luminal A breast cancer is sensitive to endocrine therapy. Patients with breast cancer who undergo excision should be followed up and their prognosis should be monitored regularly. At present, imaging detection is mainly used in the conventional follow-up of breast cancer, but the cost of many imaging examinations is high, so a cost-effective examination is urgently needed.

Recent studies have found that circulating tumor cells can be used as a new type of tumor molecular marker, which can be used to diagnose tumors, judge the prognosis and monitor the efficacy by detecting the number and characteristic protein expression of circulating tumor cells. Because circulating tumor cells may develop abnormalities 4-6 months earlier than conventional imaging examination, as long as circulating tumor cells of patients are abnormal, timely PET-CT examination will neither miss diagnosis nor delay the condition.
